DONE    

    Working on splitting up Server into BaseServer + Server.

    This will let me move most common server functionality into a base class, suitable for reuse with other server implementions, while moving all the connection handshaking stuff into the Server class.

    Will be quite a bit of work though, so trying this out in a branch.

    Brought across basics, allocators.

    Next I need to bring across the packet factories, message factories etc.

    Goal is eventually to bring across the whole common functionality that should be the same for all server implementations, eg. everything except the actual connection negotiation packets basically.

    Ported across most public functions, in a hacky way, lots of stuff commented out.

TODO

    Need to bring across rest of protected support functions as well, that are relevant at least. This will be a tricky refactor.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

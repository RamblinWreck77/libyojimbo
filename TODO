DONE    

TODO

    Working on splitting up Server into BaseServer + Server.

    This will let me move most common server functionality into a base class, suitable for reuse with other server implementions, while moving all the connection handshaking stuff into the Server class.

    Will be quite a bit of work though, so trying this out in a branch.

    =========================================

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    Only allow fragmented packets if they are encrypted in secure mode. Unencrypted ones will not be accepted.

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D
